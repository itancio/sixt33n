# sixt33n
The objective of this project is to use voice commands to control how the car moves. Each voice command is associated with one of these events: drive straight far, drive straight close, turn right, and turn left. The voice command signals will undergo PCA projection and classification process in real-time. For every successful classification, Sixt33n should set to start drive mode and execute the intended action. The project helps us understand the entire pipeline of integrating analog devices, filtering system, classification process, approximation and actuator deployment. Different lab modules help us focus and build upon each learning objectives and apply it to real world objects.
